From the previous positive working experience with the founder of [warehouse.space](% post_url warehouse.space %) I accepted the offer to create another website - [packdispatch.com](https://packdispatch.com). 

At the beginning of the project I have inherited a legacy codebase, which I re-wrote into the latest HTML5 and [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) with a help of [Gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/). On every modification all styles, scripts and images are ran through the Gulp "pipes" to serve all the assets to the client in the most optimal way.

The main component of this one-page website is the onboarding form. I have created this form with the help of PHP and AJAX along with adding some great floating labels CSS animations.

</div>

The secondary component of this page is the Freshdesk plugin for online helpdesk and support. Relying on not-so structured at the time documentation I have embedded Freshdesk plugin into the page.
