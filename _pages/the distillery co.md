I have contracted for Adelaide based digital agency - [The Distillery Co](https://thedistillery.co/) - during the May of 2017 as a front-end web developer. 

My main task was to convert static PDF mockups for [Scotch College website](https://web.archive.org/web/20180811223753/https://www.scotch.sa.edu.au/) into SCSS, JavaScript and HTML5. This web reource is created on Drupal 6.

Here are the examples of completed work.
