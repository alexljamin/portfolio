I was approached by a small law firm to help the company to overcome current technical challenges. The company never had an active system administrator so I had keep that in mind when proposing my solution. After doing research and interviewing company employees I was able to resolve the following issues:
- Upgraded the Microsoft Office365 subscription tier to Business Premium what includes Outlook
- Organised the email migration from the local email server to Outlook 
- Updated DNS records to point to Microsoft services
- Purchased online hosting 
- Renewed the domain name for the next year
- Migrated data from local server file storage to OneDrive
- Made all the VMs, what previously ran on the local ESXi server, to be accessible from local VMware Worstation 12
- Upgraded RAM on all company laptops to 8GB
- Introduced Linksys XAC1900 to handle all the wireless networking
- Submitted old router, modem, patch panel, server and enternet cables to the nearest electronics recycling facility

At first availability in the area this office is planned to be connected to NBN. If NBN will have the same up/down speed as it is with ADSL2+ now, then introduce optical fiber to the premises.
