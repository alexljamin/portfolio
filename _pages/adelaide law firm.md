I was approached by a small law firm to help the company to overcome current technical challenges. The company never had an active system administrator and unfortunetely does not have budget to keep one full-time, that means that my proposed solution should:
- Rely on as little on-premises hardware as possible. 
- Have 24/7 professional customer support.
- Be remotely maintenable.
- Have a gradual learning curve to decrease possible business technical outages.
- Outperform current technology stack.

After interviewing company employees and researching named issues I was able to resolve the following matters:
- Upgraded the Microsoft Office365 subscription tier to Business Premium what includes Outlook.
- Organised the email migration from the local email server to Outlook.
- Worked closely with Microsoft Office365 technicians to troubleshoot platform perfomance and email retention policy issues.
- Updated DNS records to point to Microsoft services.
- Purchased online hosting.
- Renewed the domain name for the next year.
- Migrated data from local server file storage to OneDrive.
- Made all the VMs, what previously ran on the local ESXi server, to be accessible from local VMware Worstation 12.
- Upgraded RAM on all company laptops to 8GB.
- Introduced Linksys XAC1900 to handle all the wireless networking.
- Submitted old router, modem, patch panel, server and enternet cables to the nearest electronics recycling facility.

A proposed future plan covers:
- Upgrade current web resource from outdated Joomla 2.5 to latest Joomla or Wordpress.
- Introduce concepts of cybersecurity into company daily business operations.
- Connect to NBN at first availability in the area. If NBN will have the same up/down speed as it is with ADSL2+ now, then introduce optical fiber to the premises.
