A small law firm in Adelaide has introduced me to their company current technical challendges and asked for my opinion on how possibly I could help them with the resolution of these challenges.

I started my research with observations and interviews with company employees. As my research progressed I was able to identify the following major points:
1. Company is fully dependent on in-house out-dated hardware and all of the services operate through this hardware
2. There is no active system administrator to maintain, troubleshoot or provide support
3. Employees have never received IT training as such and would continue working by "trial and error" method

I have proposed the following plan:
- Decrease the dependency on in-house hardware to the bare minimum and migrate to the cloud
- Upgrade in-house hardware
- Recycle or re-purpose old electronics
