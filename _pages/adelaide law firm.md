I was approached by a small law firm to help the company to overcome current technical challenges. The company never had an active system administrator so I had keep that in mind when proposing my solution. After doing research and interviewing company employees I was able to resolve the following issues:
- Upgraded the Microsoft Office365 subscription tier to Business Premium what includes the Outlook
- Organised the email migration from the local email server to Outlook 
- Ensured the DNS works correctly
- Renewed the domain name for the next year
- Migrated data from local server file storage to OneDrive
- Made all the VMs, what previously ran on the local ESXi server, to be accessible from local VMware Worstation 12
- Upgraded RAM on all company laptops to 8GB
- Introduced Linksys XAC1900 to handle all the wireless networking
- Decomposed old router, modem, patch panel, server and enternet cables

At first availability in the area this office is planned to be connected to NBN or if up/down speed will remain the same as it is with ADSL2+ now, then introduce fiber.
