Startup Weekend is a 54 hours hackathon held all over the world and bound to the particular theme. Such a short period of time allows participants to quickly test an idea and build an MVP. 

I have had a chance to be a part of the team who, during three long days, delivered a platform for leveraging power grind outages. Thanks to my team - Derek, John and Paul, I have learnt a lot from you and look forward to build something again in the future.
