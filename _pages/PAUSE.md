PAUSE magazine was founded in 2009 by students to shed some light on university life. Every year a new editor-in-chief would be chosen to lead the development and production of 2 issues. I was lucky enough to start contributing to the magazine as a volunteer for 4 months, until I was offered a position of an editor-in-chief. 

My responsibilities were:
- Work with lecturers of Creative Writing and Visual Communicaiton to motivate students to start contributing content to the magazine
- Organise all the materials from the previous publications in online public storage
- Organise content and produce 2 digital magazine issues in Adobe InDesign
- Create a development plan and recruit the next team of students

As I have completed my term at PAUSE I have decided to write my [thesis](https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/97926) based on all the valuable experience I have got. 

Special thanks to Jari - head of marketing - for always being supportive and trusting me in my decisions.
