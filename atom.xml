   <title>PAUSE magazine</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;PAUSE magazine was founded in 2009 by students to shed some light on university life. Every year a new editor-in-chief would be chosen to lead the development and production of 2 issues. I was lucky enough to start contributing to the magazine as a volunteer for 4 months, until I was offered a position of an editor-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with lecturers of Creative Writing and Visual Communicaiton to motivate students to start contributing content to the magazine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organise all the materials from the previous publications in online public storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organise content and produce 2 digital magazine issues in Adobe InDesign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a development plan and recruit the next team of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have completed my term at PAUSE I have decided to write my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/97926&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; based on all the valuable experience I have got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linkedin.com/in/jari-wahlstr%C3%B6m-96344a87/&quot;&gt;Jari Wahlstr√∂m&lt;/a&gt; - former head of marketing and communications - for always being supportive and trusting me in my decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Warehouse.space is an innovative warehousing company, what provides self-storage and vertical storage solutions all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to create a responsive website for the company. Warehouse.space founder had already some ideas on how website should look and feel, and purchased a static HTML5 template. The purchased template was my starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company founder and I together, we have went through multiple iterations both from the design and codebase perspective. As the number of static pages started to grow, for example with introduction of 7 different languages to the UI, I have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gulp.js&lt;/a&gt; integration to handle all the build processes including CSS minification, JS minification and live browser reloading with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.browsersync.io/&quot;&gt;BrowserSync&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also experimented with introduction of flat-file CMS into the project, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sitecake.com/&quot;&gt;SiteCake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org/&quot;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagekit.com&quot;&gt;Pagekit&lt;/a&gt;, but based on my experience at the time - the migration from current static multipage web resource to one of these platforms was not fully supported. The transition to CMS is inevitable, that is why I am continuing to search for the suitable content management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this live project here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://warehouse.space&quot;&gt;https://warehouse.space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2017-03-17T00:00:00+10:30</updated>
   <id>alljamin.com/adelaide law firm</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was approached by a small law firm to help the company to overcome current technical challenges. The company never had an active system administrator and unfortunately does not have a budget to keep one full-time, that means that my proposed solution should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rely on as little on-premises hardware as possible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have 24/7 professional customer support&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be remotely maintainable&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a gradual usage learning curve to decrease possible business technical outages&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outperform current infrastructure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are just a few issues what company faced regularly:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Local email server would stop responding. Former sys admin needed to be contacted in order to resolve the issue - the process can easily take months.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No one could see and manage each other calendars. There was a local Windows XP ESXi VM with a calendar software what can only be accessible by one person at a time.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;File sharing and storage was on a separate Windows XP VM on a same local server with a maximum storage space of 150GB. The server could only be upgraded to the maximum of 500GB SAS drives. Two out 5 drives were failing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No WiFi available. Employees were working on laptops connected with a wire to a switch, not being able to move in the office.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After interviewing company employees and researching named issues I was able to resolve the following matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgraded the Microsoft Office365 subscription tier to Business Premium what includes Outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Created a shared calendar what each employee can see, edit and access simultaneously.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organised the email migration from the local email server to Outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked closely with Microsoft Office365 technicians to troubleshoot platform performance and email retention policy issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated DNS records to point to Microsoft Office 365 Outlook services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purchased online hosting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renewed the domain name for the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migrated data from local server file storage to OneDrive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made all the ESXi VMs be accessible from local VMware Workstation 12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgraded RAM on all company laptops to 8GB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduced &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.linksys.com/au/p/P-XAC1900/&quot;&gt;Linksys XAC1900&lt;/a&gt; to handle all the wireless networking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submitted old router, modem, patch panel, server and internet cables to the nearest electronics recycling facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, the company founder decided to close his main office and move operations to home office. Home office had to accommodate the new changes in the business. Based on my advice the following actions were performed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Convert former employees Office365 Outlook accounts into Shared Mailboxes and remove their licenses. This gave the founder a chance to be able to receive emails from all his former employees‚Äô emails and respond from his email address. This action also reduced the number of active Office365 subscriptions narrowing it down just to one - significantly decreasing the running expenses. I found this &lt;a href=&quot;https://support.office.com/en-us/article/remove-a-former-employee-from-office-365-44d96212-4d90-4027-9aa9-a95eddb367d1&quot;&gt;Microsoft KB article&lt;/a&gt; particulary useful.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;In order to bring &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.lexmark.com/en_nz/printer/4834/Lexmark-X656de&quot;&gt;Lexmark x656de&lt;/a&gt; MFP online I had to setup powerline network with two &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.tp-link.com/au/products/details/cat-18_TL-PA7010P-KIT.html&quot;&gt;TP-Link TL-PA7010P Gigabit Passthrough&lt;/a&gt; adapters.&lt;/li&gt;

   <updated>2017-10-12T00:00:00+10:30</updated>
   <id>alljamin.com/techstars</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Techstars Adelaide Accelerator 2017 is the first APAC Techstars program. The main theme of this program is defence and security. This program is supported by such corporate partners as Boeing, Thales, Codan and SAAB. 10 startup companies were chosen to participate in the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was amongst five associates who helped both local Techstars team and 10 startup companies with solving their design challenges. By being a Design Associate I was responsible for creating print materials for Techstars for internal and public events. I was always available for any company, participating in the accelerator, to approach me and to ask for help with one or another matter. It was challenging, but rewarding to understand and then visualise complex product and service concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken every opportunity to initiate improvement in the general approach towards understanding and applying design in the company. For example, I started exploring the symbol for cybersecurity company and presented the founders with a few ideas - shown below. I also organised a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/the_wallet_project.html&quot;&gt;The Wallet project&lt;/a&gt; workshop for all the founders explaining concepts of personas, empathy and usability on practice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2017-11-17T00:00:00+10:30</updated>
   <id>alljamin.com/personal website revamp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So, the day finally came and the new version of my portfolio is up and running! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous portfolio was missing the dynamic generation of HTML, so that all the pages and links had to be created every time by hand. That is not the most efficient way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to give a closer look on my technology stack and came up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;: separate local version of Ruby, eliminate dangerous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.com&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; packages: gulp, vendor autoprefix, proper SASS compilation, CSS minification, file rename, browser live reload, image minification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (Liquid, Front Matter): static HTML generation, relative urls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;GIT&lt;/a&gt;: version control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;: hosting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://namecheap.com&quot;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;: domain registar, Whois Guard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: SSL, DNSSEC, CDN, HTTP/2, Automatic HTTP to HTTPS rewrites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining everything together, and spending as little as $12, I have a fully functional web resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the detailed instructions on you can build something for yourself with my project as a starting point on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alljamin/portfolio&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>alljamin.com/pack and dispatch</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;From the previous positive working experience with the founder of &lt;a href=&quot;% post_url warehouse.space %&quot;&gt;warehouse.space&lt;/a&gt; I accepted the offer to create another website - &lt;a href=&quot;https://packdispatch.com&quot;&gt;packdispatch.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of the project I have inherited a legacy codebase, which I re-wrote into the latest HTML5 and &lt;a href=&quot;https://sass-lang.com/&quot;&gt;SASS&lt;/a&gt; with a help of &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gulp.js&lt;/a&gt;. On every modification all styles, scripts and images are ran through the Gulp ‚Äúpipes‚Äù to serve all the assets to the client in the most optimal way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main component of this one-page website is the onboarding form. I have created this form with the help of PHP and AJAX along with adding some great floating labels CSS animations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXVTP0Sl2No&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The secondary component of this page is the Freshdesk plugin for online helpdesk and support. Relying on not-so structured at the time documentation I have embedded Freshdesk plugin into the page.&lt;/p&gt;

   <updated>2018-08-26T00:00:00+09:30</updated>
   <id>alljamin.com/peregrine corporation</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.peregrine.com.au/&quot;&gt;Peregrine Corporation&lt;/a&gt; is South Australia (SA) largest privately-owned retail company. The company holds various major businesses under its umbrella. One of the South Australia recognised brands is &lt;a href=&quot;https://ontherun.com.au&quot;&gt;OTR&lt;/a&gt; - the concept of a convenience store combined with the fuel station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After contracting for OTR marketing for two months I was given a chance to join a OTR marketing team as a graphic designer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;digital&quot;&gt;Digital&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My initial responsibilities included mastering the digital signage platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://signstix.com&quot;&gt;SignStix&lt;/a&gt; and developing the content for it. My main goal was to explore motion in digital menus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;videoWrapper&quot;&gt;
    &lt;iframe width=&quot;560&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/aoMEwId32hI&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/gouger-st.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of digital signage in store&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also fully wrote front-end code for two landing pages. One for &lt;a href=&quot;https://tracksidevillas.com.au&quot;&gt;Trackside Villas&lt;/a&gt; and another one for &lt;a href=&quot;https://easyasotr.com/&quot;&gt;Easy as OTR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;print&quot;&gt;Print&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further I started to work on the production of the retail and marketing portal (RAMP). RAMP is split into 24 periods, for each period there was a need to produce a set of signage and signage allocation guide. Number of signage would usually vary from 50 pieces to 200 pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/fridge-stickers.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of printed signage in store 1&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/ice-cream-fridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of printed signage in store 2&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/nozzads.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example of printed signage in store 3&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The allocation guide is carefully crafted InDesign document with ~90-95 pages of content. It is certainly a massive document and it was important to improve its readability. It took multiple major iterations to simplify the document including:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;three column grid system&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;unified styling and spacing for titles, body text and image captions&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;elimination of spot colours and copy-pasted artwork&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/ramp-stacked.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Printed issues of RAMP&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/ramp-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Open printed issue of RAMP&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important involvement of mine was the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontherun.com.au/pages/about-us/otr-give/&quot;&gt;OTRGive&lt;/a&gt; initiative. OTRGive is a community program what brought together 36 SA local charities and foundations, and allowed OTR site customers to choose which organisation they want to support with their purchases via OTR App. I was responsible for creating visuals for the promotion of this program, including brochure, staff name badge surrounds, tri-fold, posters and flyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/brochure-open.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OTRGive brochure&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/table-top-trifolds.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OTRGive table tops&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/otrgive-flyers-badges.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;images of tri-fold&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/front-door-sticker.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;front door sticker&quot; /&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/img/peregrine/otrgive-namebadge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;OTRGive staff member badge surround&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workflow-management-and-optimisation&quot;&gt;Workflow management and optimisation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the main components of signage are product images, more than often these images will be supplied in a wide range of formats. To ensure that every image will be printed correctly I had to process each one of them to check the file extension, colour profile, DPI, presence of shadows and background. When shadows and background were present I had to manually mask the product to have it on transparent background. Usually there will be around 30-40 images what needed to be processed. To re-purpose my time, spent on image contouring, I was able to outsource this work and built an extensive library of images ready for print.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;acknowledgement&quot;&gt;Acknowledgement&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I would like to thank Simon Rudduck (Head of Brand) and Nigel Venning (Lead Creative) for sharing their expertise and providing me an extensive guidance and support during my time in the company.

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;PAUSE magazine was founded in 2009 by students to shed some light on university life. Every year a new editor-in-chief would be chosen to lead the development and production of 2 issues. I was lucky enough to start contributing to the magazine as a volunteer for 4 months, until I was offered a position of an editor-in-chief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My responsibilities were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Work with lecturers of Creative Writing and Visual Communicaiton to motivate students to start contributing content to the magazine&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organise all the materials from the previous publications in online public storage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organise content and produce 2 digital magazine issues in Adobe InDesign&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a development plan and recruit the next team of students&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have completed my term at PAUSE I have decided to write my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theseus.fi/handle/10024/97926&quot;&gt;thesis&lt;/a&gt; based on all the valuable experience I have got.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Jari - head of marketing - for always being supportive and trusting me in my decisions.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Warehouse.space is an innovative warehousing company, what provides self storage and vertical storage solutions all around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was invited to create a responsive website for the company. Warehouse.space founder had already some ideas on how website should look and feel, and purchased a static HTML5 template. The purchased template was my starting point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Company founder and I together, we have went through multiple iterations both from the design and codebase perspective. As the number of static pages started to grow, for example with introduction of 7 different languages to the UI, I have implemented &lt;a href=&quot;https://gulpjs.com/&quot;&gt;Gulp.js&lt;/a&gt; integration to handle all the build processes including CSS minification, JS minification and live browser reloading with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.browsersync.io/&quot;&gt;BrowserSync&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have also experimented with introduction of flat-file CMS into the project, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://sitecake.com/&quot;&gt;SiteCake&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://getgrav.org/&quot;&gt;Grav&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://pagekit.com&quot;&gt;Pagekit&lt;/a&gt;, but based on my experience at the time - the migration from current static multipage web resource to one of these platforms was not fully supported. The transition to CMS is inevitable, that is why I am continuing to search for the suitable content management solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Check out this live project here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://warehouse.space&quot;&gt;https://warehouse.space&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was approached by a small law firm to help the company to overcome current technical challenges. The company never had an active system administrator and unfortunetely does not have budget to keep one full-time, that means that my proposed solution should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Rely on as little on-premises hardware as possible.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have 24/7 professional customer support.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Be remotely maintenable.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have a gradual learning curve to decrease possible business technical outages.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Outperform current technology stack.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After interviewing company employees and researching named issues I was able to resolve the following matters:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgraded the Microsoft Office365 subscription tier to Business Premium what includes Outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Organised the email migration from the local email server to Outlook.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Worked closely with Microsoft Office365 technicians to troubleshoot platform perfomance and email retention policy issues.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Updated DNS records to point to Microsoft services.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Purchased online hosting.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Renewed the domain name for the next year.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Migrated data from local server file storage to OneDrive.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Made all the VMs, what previously ran on the local ESXi server, to be accessible from local VMware Worstation 12.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgraded RAM on all company laptops to 8GB.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduced Linksys XAC1900 to handle all the wireless networking.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Submitted old router, modem, patch panel, server and enternet cables to the nearest electronics recycling facility.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A proposed future plan covers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Upgrade current web resource from outdated Joomla 2.5 to latest Joomla or Wordpress.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Introduce concepts of cybersecurity into company daily business operations.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Connect to NBN at first availability in the area. If NBN will have the same up/down speed as it is with ADSL2+ now, then introduce optical fiber to the premises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

   <title>Techstars Adelaide Accelerator</title>

   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Techstars Adelaide Accelerator 2017 is the first APAC Techstars program. The main theme of this program is defence and security. This program is supported by such corporate partners as Boeing, Thales, Codan and SAAB. 10 startup companies were chosen to participate in the accelerator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was amongst five associates who helped both local Techstars team and 10 startup companies with solving their design challenges. By being a Design Associate I was responsible for creating print materials for Techstars for internal and public events. I was always available for any company, participating in the accelerator, to approach me and to ask for help with one or another matter. It was challenging, but rewarding to understand and then visualise complex product and service concepts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have taken every opportunity to initiate improvement in the general approach towards understanding and applying design in the company. For example, I started exploring the symbol for cybersecurity company and presented the founders with a few ideas - shown below. I also organised a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dschool-old.stanford.edu/groups/designresources/wiki/4dbb2/the_wallet_project.html&quot;&gt;The Wallet project&lt;/a&gt; workshop for all the founders explaining concepts of personas, empathy and usability on practice.&lt;/p&gt;

   <id>alljamin.com/personal website revamp</id>
   <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So the day finally came and the new version of my portfolio is up and running! Yay!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous portfolio was missing the dynamic generation of HTML, so that all the pages and links had to be created every time by hand. That is not the most efficient way of doing things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time I decided to give a closer look on my technology stack and came up with the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://brew.sh&quot;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;: separate local version of Ruby, eliminate dangerous &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sudo&lt;/code&gt; commands&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://npmjs.com&quot;&gt;NPM&lt;/a&gt; packages: gulp, vendor autoprefix, proper SASS compilation, CSS minification, file rename, browser live reload, image minification&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; (Liquid, Front Matter): static HTML generation, relative urls&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://git-scm.com/&quot;&gt;GIT&lt;/a&gt;: version control&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pages.github.com&quot;&gt;Github Pages&lt;/a&gt;: hosting&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://namecheap.com&quot;&gt;Namecheap&lt;/a&gt;: domain registar, Whois Guard&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://cloudflare.com&quot;&gt;Cloudflare&lt;/a&gt;: SSL, DNSSEC, CDN, HTTP/2, Automatic HTTP to HTTPS rewrites&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Combining everything together, and spending as little as AUD12, I have a fully functional web resource, what presents my online presence in a modern and optimised way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can find the detailed instructions on you can build something for yourself with my project as a starting point on my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/alljamin/portfolio&quot;&gt;Github repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
