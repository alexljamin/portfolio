[Peregrine Corporation](https://www.peregrine.com.au/) is South Australia (SA) largest privately-owned retail company. The company owns and franchasees multiple food brands. With BP fuel stations cooperation Peregrine Corporation introduced the concept of convinience store - [OTR](ontherun.com.au). After working for 2 months as a contractor I became a part of newly formed (at the time) creative team as a graphic designer.

### Digital

As a graphic designer my initial responsibilities included mastering the digital signage platform called [SignStix](signstix.com) and developing the content for it. My main goal was to explore motion in digital menus.

I have also fully wrote front-end code for two landing pages. One for [Trackside Villas](tracksidevillas.com.au) and another one for [Easy as OTR](https://easyasotr.com/).

### Print

Further I started to work on the production of the retail and marketing portal (RAMP). RAMP is split into 24 periods, for each period there was a need to produce a set of signage and signage allocation guide. Number of signage would usually vary from 50 pieces to 200 pieces.

The allocation guide is carefully crafted InDesign document with ~90-95 pages of content. It is certainly a massive document and it was important to improve its readability. It took multiple major iterations to simplify the document including: 
- three column grid system
- unified styling and spacing for titles, body text and image captions
- elimination of spot colours and copy-pasted artwork

Another important involvement of mine was the [OTRGive](http://www.ontherun.com.au/pages/about-us/otr-give/) initiative. OTRGive is a community program what brought together 36 SA local charities and foundations, and allowed OTR site customers to choose which organisation they want to support with their purchases via OTR App. I was responsible for creating visuals for the promotion of this program, including booklet, staff name badge surrounds, tri-fold, posters and flyers.

### Time-management

As the number of tasks and my responsibilities encreased I started to look into identifying processes to be outsourced. For example, one of the main components of signage were product images, more than often these images will be supplied in a wide range of formats. Once images were received they needed to be gone through a Adobe Photoshop action script to automate the DPI, color profile and file extension conversion for press. Furthermore, if an image had a background or a shadow - these elements needed to be masked by hand. Post-processing images is a very time-consuming task. But, I was able to find a talented freelancer on Upwork, who would happily take on this task. From that moment onwards, I was able to re-purpose my time to all the other high-priority outstanding tasks.
