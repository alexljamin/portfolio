### Company

Dynastea a high-tea catering and crockery hire service operating from Aldinga Beach, South Australia.

I have been involved with the business on multiple levels. Starting from general guidance on business and trademark registration to business assets creation. Let me briefly cover all the steps:

1. The initial step was to register the `com.au` domain name, for which it is required to have an active ABN. Once ABN and trademark got registered domain with [VentraIP](https://ventraip.com.au/) was purchased. 
2. Then I have signed the business up with Google Suite (or G Suite) for professional custom domain email address - @dynastea.com.au. 
3. And, the branding process begun. We went through many different ideas and iterations finally settling on one.
