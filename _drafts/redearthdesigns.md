### Company

Red Earth Designs was a small advertisement agency ran out Hindmarsh office here in Adelaide. It specialised in the production of both print and digital media. The agency took on a wide range of projects from vinyl car wrap design to website design. The majority of clients came from small to medium size businesses.

### Position description

At Red Earth Designs I was working on the position of web designer. Even though my initial responsibilities covered only website design and development, over time I started to get involved with the server configuration (back-end) and project management. 

#### Back-end configuration

Briefly about [Crucial](https://www.crucial.com.au/) shared hosting (back-end) modifications:
- AutoSSL functionality got enabled for every parked domain. 
- Every parked website had SSH key generated with RSA-4096 algorithm. 
- For temporary URLs and to present work in progress (WIP) to clients I have used Password Protected Directories along with `robots.txt` `User-agent: * Disallow: /` and `<meta name="robots" content="noindex, nofollow">` in every protected directory and in page header. 
- Custom configured server-side PHP settings allowed larger memory and larger file size upload for raw footage.

#### Project management

Some words about project management:
- Provided estimates on the approximate duration of each project.
- Created sitemaps based on the client requirements.
- Addressed the client feedback by making needed revisions and alterations.
- Kept clients aware on what stage the project is currently on.

#### Content Management System

The agency was working with a particular type of content management system (CMS) called [CouchCMS](https://www.couchcms.com/). As I have not had a prior experience with this CMS I had to spend additional time to explore and learn my way through it. A lot of essential project-based CMS configuration was done as my own initiative. For example, the official documentation did not cover the concept of local development with MAMP, but by trial and error I was able to draw out the working configuration. Additionally, I was able to identify and fix some previously unaddressed CMS configuration issues:
- Removed explicit global URLs defined as `K_SITE_URL`.
- Removed database prefixes, as each project had their own separate database and there was no need to store multiple databases in one.
- Created whitelabeled CMS with the agency branding based on the latest CouchCMS release.
- Made all copy-pasted text into `<cms:editable type='richtext' ... />` to always be plain text - to eliminate text styling issues. Later on, I moved from `type='richtext'` to `type='textarea'` with using `<cms:nl2br></cms:nl2br>` in the front end.
- Changed file upload and memory limits to be higher in order to support raw footage upload.

Most of my findings are captured in my [GitHub Gists](https://gist.github.com/alljamin).
